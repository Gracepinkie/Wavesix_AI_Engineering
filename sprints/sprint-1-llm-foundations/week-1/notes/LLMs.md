# ðŸ§  Week 1 Notes: GenAI Jumpstart â€“ LLMs in Action
# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and how to use them.

Learn prompt engineering fundamentals.

Explore different LLM playgrounds.

Set up your development environment and repo.

Start logging prompts and analyzing model behavior.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
1. What is an LLM?
A Large Language Model is a transformer-based neural network trained on large-scale text data.

Examples: GPT-4, Claude, PaLM, LLaMA, Mistral.

2. Transformers
Architecture behind modern LLMs (see Transformer Intro â†—ï¸Ž).

Self-attention mechanism allows understanding of context over long sequences.

3. Prompt Engineering Basics
Structure:

Role: "You are a helpful assistant..."

Context: "The user wants to summarize this..."

Instruction: "Summarize the following paragraph:"

Variables to tweak:

temperature â€“ creativity

top_p â€“ probability mass

max_tokens â€“ output length

4. LLM Tools & Playgrounds
Explore and compare:

ChatGPT

Claude

Hugging Face Spaces

Google Generative AI Studio

5. Daily LLM Use Cases
Code debugging

Regex explanation

Summarization

Text generation
